# List

a simple implementation of Linked Lists in Go, I did this mainly for practicing

---

What's next?

* Create Array from List
* Iterator for List
* Lists are currently Fifo only... quite boring actually
* Sort function? (because, you know, I can)

so yeah, that's pretty much it. Linked Lists are a terrible idea anyway.
